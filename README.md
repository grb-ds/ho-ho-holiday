## 🏆 The Goal 
Collect the most points by finishing the mini games correctly. Being the first one to arrive in Mordor doesn't mean you win but will give you a big bonus. When playing alone, try to beat the highscore! 

## 📖 Rules & Instructions

To start the game, click on the start button and select an amount of players in the window that popped up.  Click on the "Throw dice" button and see on which coloured square your pawn ended up.

According to the colour you've stopped on, a card will be taken from the pile. You will have to acomplish the chalenge displayed on the screen. There are five different colored tiles, each with a different score when completed.

When a player arrives on the last tile the game is finished and the player with the most points wins the game.


## 🕹 Minigames

- 💚 Green: Guess what's in the picture

For hardcore LOTR fans this game is easy as pie. What do you see on the picture given? You have 5 guesses to find the right answer. If you find the correct answer you win points if you lose you of course don't. 

- 💙 Blue: Memory Game

Test your memory with this memory game. Start the game by flipping a card. Then try to find another card that has the same image as the first. If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped back with the face down. Try to remember these images as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer you play. When you find a pair they are removed from the board and when you find all the pairs in this memory, you have won.

- 💛 Yellow Puzzle Game

Can you make the puzzle? Place the puzzle pieces on the right place to reveal a LOTR related picture. 

- 🧡 Orange: Riddle Game

Like in the LOTR movies, you have to find the answer to these riddles. These riddles require careful thinking because nothing is what it seems, but sometimes the answer is just right in front of you.
